# Chess++

## Idea
This program will simulate a chess game for beginners and advanced players who want to take the game into their own hands. Beginners will be able to learn the basics of how each piece moves up to the complex openings and book moves. Advanced players will be able to improve the game that they have come to learn with pieces they want to add and establish their moves. These players can then connect to the server for sorta-ish online multiplayer

## Goal
The goal is to teach users how to play chess, create new pieces and new ways to play, and allow for local server 2 player connectivity or single player games to improve with oneself.
